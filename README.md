CPPLine is a C++ command-line argument parser designed to simplify the process of handling command-line options and arguments in C++ applications. It leverages modern C++ features, including modules and concepts, to provide a clean and easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- Support for boolean, integer, string and custom type options.
- Support for positional arguments.
- Aliases for options (e.g., `--help` and `-h`).
- Customizable error handling with detailed context.

## Requirements

- C++20 compatible compiler with modules support (e.g., GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.28+).
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) (for running tests).
